If you like the character and would like to donate you can use the link below to send me some funds.  Which I would really apprecitae since animating this character can get time consuming.

You can change the number on the end if you like and that will change the donation ammount. 

Example: "paypal.me/Kazecat/3" will send $3 USD or "paypal.me/Kazecat/5" will send $5 USD 

I'd appreciate donations but they aren't mandatory.
