Basic Controls
--------------

Jumbo is a 4 button character that currently only has his full standing set of normals, 1 aerial attack, 1 crouching attack and 1 joke attack out of a taunt.  More will be added later on.  His throw is still set like KFM's throw so it won't work due to their sizes being so vastly different.  I will add his own throw later on.

Notes
----------------------

As an intentional character Flaw, Jumbo only believes in power and size.  So he only trains for getting bigger and stronger, he does do cardio in the least and thus tires easily from running or Super Jumping.
So these actions will drain your super gauge.

Combos
----------------------
I tried to design him so that the Butt drops would be ideal combo finishers but terrible moves to just throw out there.  So try stringing his attacks together and ending with Butt drops.

S. LP, S.LK, S.HP, S.HK, down+J. HK - Should be an easy example.

Basic Idea/ Archetype
---------------------

Jumbo is meant to be the "Mighty Glacier" type of character so his mobility is supposed to be terrible but his power and range should be terrifying.  Thus he can't jump over standard opponents and they most often can't jump over him.  Elephants can not run, but they can amble with is just a faster walk and Jumbo is no different.  His crushing attacks do serious damage so try to set up your opponent so you can sit on them.
Please have fun with this character I worked pretty hard on it and I just want everyone to enjoy him.
