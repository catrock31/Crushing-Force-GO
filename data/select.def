[ExtraStages]
 ;Put extra stages here. They will be available in modes that allow selecting
 ;stage manually. For example, you can insert "stages/mybg.def".
 ;
 ;Optional parameters may follow on the same line, separated by commas.
 ;Each parameter has the form:
 ;    paramname = paramvalue
 ;where paramname is the name of the parameter type, and paramvalue is the value
 ;to assign that parameter. The optional parameters are:
 ;
 ; - music<roundno>
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the music file path that should be
 ;   used at the start of round. Music volume, loopstart and loopend values can
 ;   follow, separated by spaces. Tracks will be played randomly from the
 ;   available pool if multiple parameters have been assigned or bgmusic is
 ;   present in the stage DEF file. Setting optional <roundno> (typed as number)
 ;   decides round on which the music will be played (defaults to 1 if omitted)
 ;
 ; - musiclife
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the music file path that should be
 ;   used when player's controlled character has (by default) less then 30% life
 ;   during deciding round (only affects side that is at risk of being
 ;   defeated). Further adjustments available via stage DEF file. Music volume,
 ;   loopstart and loopend values can follow, separated by spaces.  Tracks will
 ;   be played randomly from the available pool if multiple parameters have been
 ;   assigned or bgmusic.life is present in the stage DEF file.
 ;
 ; - musicvictory
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the music file path that should kick
 ;   in right after the final round K.O. and continue throughout the victory
 ;   screen. Music volume, loopstart and loopend frame values can follow,
 ;   separated by spaces. Tracks will be played randomly from the available pool
 ;   if multiple parameters have been assigned or bgmusic.victory is present in
 ;   the stage DEF file.
 ;
 ; - order
 ;   IKEMEN feature: Set the paramvalue to the ordering priority to give the
 ;   stage in Arcade and Time Attack modes. If there is at least 1 stage with
 ;   assigned order, facing opponent with the exact order paramvalue will result
 ;   in stage being randomly chosen from stages with the matching order. Stages
 ;   can have multiple order parameters assigned at the same time.
 ;
 ; - unlock
 ;   IKEMEN feature: paramvalue is executed as Lua code condition, right after
 ;   new game mode is initiated and upon returning to main menu. If it evaluates
 ;   to boolean 'true' the stage will become manually selectable. On 'false' it
 ;   will be hidden. Due to parameters syntax, 'unlock' has to be the very last
 ;   parameter used in line (everything that follows is treated as a pure Lua
 ;   code). Default: true.
